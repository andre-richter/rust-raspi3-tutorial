# Tutorial 0F - Global `println!`

Coming soon!

This lesson will teach about:
- Restructuring the current codebase.
- Realizing global println! and print! macros by reusing macros from the Rust
  standard library.
- The NullLock, a wrapper that allows using global static variables without
  explicit need for `unsafe {}` code. It is a teaching concept that is only
  valid in single-threaded IRQ-disabled environments. However, it already lays
  the groundwork for the introduction of proper locking mechanisms, e.g.  real
  Spinlocks.
